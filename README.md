Credit Card Fraud Detection
This project is focused on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using a dataset of transactions and applying various data analysis techniques. The notebook outlines steps from loading the dataset to performing data quality checks and generating insights.

Project Structure
The notebook includes the following key steps:

Data Loading: The dataset is loaded using pandas, and the initial data structure is examined.

Data Quality Check:

Missing values are checked across all features.
Duplicate rows are identified.
Statistical Summary: A statistical summary of the dataset provides insights into the distribution of key features.

Requirements
To run the notebook, the following Python libraries are required:

numpy
pandas
seaborn
You can install these packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas seaborn
Usage
Clone the repository or download the notebook to your local machine.

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
Run the Jupyter Notebook: Open the notebook in JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook to execute the cells step-by-step.

Dataset: Ensure you have the creditcard.csv dataset in the same directory as the notebook. You can download the dataset here.

Dataset Information
The dataset used in this project is from a Kaggle competition for credit card fraud detection. It contains 284,807 transactions, including 492 fraudulent ones. Each transaction is characterized by 30 features, including the Class feature that indicates whether the transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0).

Future Improvements
Implement machine learning models to classify fraudulent transactions.
Explore additional feature engineering techniques.
Analyze model performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
